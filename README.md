 Introduce bifurcating artery problem

‚Ä¢ Geometry: carotid artery from Grab CAD

‚Ä¢ Inlet: 0.315 m/s, outlets: 13332 Pa, no-slip walls

‚Ä¢ Real velocity is pulsatile, this is approximation

‚Ä¢ œÅ =1060 kg/m3, ¬µ = 0.0035 Pa s (based on blood)

‚Ä¢ Approximate as Newtonian fluid for simplicity

‚Ä¢ Reynolds number of 600 (based on inlet diameter)

‚Ä¢ Engineering background
