# Ansys project

 Introduce bifurcating artery problem

• Geometry: carotid artery from Grab CAD

• Inlet: 0.315 m/s, outlets: 13332 Pa, no-slip walls

• Real velocity is pulsatile, this is approximation

• ρ =1060 kg/m3, µ = 0.0035 Pa s (based on blood)

• Approximate as Newtonian fluid for simplicity

• Reynolds number of 600 (based on inlet diameter)

• Engineering background
